## Installing

If your shell is located in the PySimba Directory, which you can clone, you can install the package locally with:
> `pip install -e .` 

Or the path to the package instead of '.'

## Usage
If you run it in the python terminal:
> `import py_simba`
> `py_simba.main()`

Or just test other functions alone.

If you want to run it just as a package in your shell:
> `python3 -m py_simba`
