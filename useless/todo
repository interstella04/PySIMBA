- Make config File, get settings from config file, also min, max for data should be in it
    - everything in settings
    - an output path
    - path were initial data lays
- comment Meas, Plot and Tools and Grab and Fitter
- think about naming variables differently
- Input smoothly, how should someone use the Code, should I write a 'main'? 
- Plot class must be prettier and accessible
- skip through all TODOS in my Code
- Change Fmn Moments dependency on expx3
- Type hinting


- add other subleading theory, make it accessible through Tag in config file


Speeding Things up:
- change np.append functions in normal list.append or list.extend functions


How to show results:
- One Plot with just data, like I already did with box and stuff
- Plot with fitted Data histogram, resulting chisq in corner
- Compare option 
- create Table with an's and cn's
